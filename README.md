# flightres
Flight Reservation System database project using MySQL and PhpMyAdmin.

This was a graduate project my last semester to learn and implement SQL. The project requirements were to create a flight reservation system for a fictitious travel agency which I named FlyRes. The goal was to create a functional backend/database that could be used to look up flights, create reservations, and generate reports. 

The files include the SQL file with all code, a technical project documentation PDF, and a Nontechnical User Manual. 

There is also a Youtube video walkthrough for nontechnical users which explains the database and how to utilize the phpMyAdmin user interface at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXBrHofRnyg
