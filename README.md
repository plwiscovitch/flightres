# flightres
Flight Reservation System database project using MySQL and PhpMyAdmin.

This was a graduate project my last semester to learn and implement SQL. The project requirements were to create a flight reservation system for a fictitious travel agency which I named FlyRes. The goal was to create a functional backend/database that could be used to look up flights, create reservations, and generate reports.
